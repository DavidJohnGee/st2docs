Webhooks
========

Webhooks allow you to integrate external systems with |st2| using HTTP
webhooks. Unlike sensors which use a "pull" approach, webhooks use a "push"
approach. This means they work by you pushing triggers directly to the |st2|
API using HTTP POST requests.

Sensors vs Webhooks
-------------------

Sensors integrate with external systems and services using a poll approach
(sensors periodically reach out to an external system to retrieve data you are
interested in) and webhooks use a push approach (your systems push data to the
|st2| API when an event you are interested in occurs).

Sensors are the preferred integration method since they offer a more granular and
tighter integration.

On the other hand, webhooks come in handy when you have an existing script or
software which you can easily modify to send a webhook to the |st2| API when an
event you are interested in occurs.

Another example where webhooks come handy is when you want to consume events
from a 3rd party service which already offer webhooks integration - e.g. GitHub

Authentication
--------------

All the requests to the /webhooks endpoints needs to be authenticated in the
same way as other API requests. There are two possible authentication approaches - API
keys and tokens. API keys are recommended for webhooks, as they do not expire. Tokens
have a fixed expiry.

API key-based
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Header` : ``St2-Api-Key``
* `Query parameter` : ``?st2-api-key``

Token-based
~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Header` : ``X-Auth-Token``
* `Query parameter` : ``?x-auth-token``


Both methods above support providing the authentication material as a header or query parameter.
A header is usually used with your scripts where you can control request headers while query
parameters are used with 3rd party services such as GitHub where you can only specify a URL.

Request Body
------------

The request body or so called trigger payload can be either JSON or URL encoded form data. The body type
is determined based on the value of the ``Content-Type`` header (``application/json`` for JSON and
``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` for URL encoded form data).

All the examples below assume JSON and as such, provide ``application/json`` for the
``Content-Type`` header value.

Using a Generic Webhook
-----------------------

By default, a generic webhook with the name ``st2`` is already registered. This webhook 
allows you to push triggers other than ``⁠⁠⁠⁠st2.core.webhook`` to the API, triggering rules 
that aren’t explicitly set to be webhooks.

The body of this request needs to be JSON and must contain the following attributes:

* ``trigger`` - Name of the trigger (e.g. ``mypack.mytrigger``)
* ``payload`` - Object with a trigger payload.

This example shows how to send data to the generic webhook using
cURL, and how to match this data using rule criteria (replace ``localhost`` with your st2 host if call remotely):

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -X POST https://localhost/api/v1/webhooks/st2 -H "X-Auth-Token: matoken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"trigger": "mypack.mytrigger", "payload": {"attribute1": "value1"}}'

Rule:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    ...
    trigger:
        type: "mypack.mytrigger"

    criteria:
        trigger.body.payload.attribute1:
            type: "equals"
            pattern: "value1"

    action:
        ref: "mypack.myaction"
        parameters:
    ...

Keep in mind that the ``trigger.type`` attribute inside the rule definition
needs to be the same as the trigger name defined in the webhook payload body.

Registering a Custom Webhook
----------------------------

|st2| also supports registering custom webhooks. You can do that by specifying
``core.st2.webhook`` trigger inside a rule definition.

Here is an excerpt from a rule which registers a new webhook named ``sample``:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    ...
    trigger:
            type: "core.st2.webhook"
            parameters:
                url: "sample"
    ...

Once this rule is created, you can use this webhook by POST-ing data to
``/v1/webhooks/sample``. The request body needs to be JSON and can contain
arbitrary data which you can match against in the rule criteria.

Note that all trailing and leading ``/`` of the ``url`` parameter are ignored by
|st2|. e.g. a value of ``/sample``, ``sample/``, ``/sample/`` and ``sample`` are
all treated the same i.e. considered identical.

POST-ing data to a custom webhook will cause a trigger with the following
attributes to be dispatched:

* ``trigger`` - Trigger name.
* ``trigger.headers`` - Dictionary containing the request headers.
* ``trigger.body`` - Dictionary containing the request body.

This example shows how to send data to a custom webhook using
cURL and how to match on this data using rule criteria:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -X POST https://localhost/api/v1/webhooks/sample -H "X-Auth-Token: matoken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"key1": "value1"}'

Rule:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    ...
    trigger:
            type: "core.st2.webhook"
            parameters:
                url: "sample"

    criteria:
        trigger.body.key1:
            type: "equals"
            pattern: "value1"

    action:
        ref: "mypack.myaction"
        parameters:
    ...
